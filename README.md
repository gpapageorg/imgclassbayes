Trained a neural network to estimate the likelyhood ratio of two images, treating them as random variables. Applied the optimal Bayes decision rule to classify the images. Implemented the project in Python using only NumPy.

This project was conducted as part of the Machine Learning course in the 4th year at the University of Patras.
